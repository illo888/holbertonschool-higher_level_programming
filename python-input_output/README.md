# Python Input/Output

This directory contains tasks related to file input/output in Python, focusing on:
- Reading and writing files safely using the `with` statement
- UTF-8 handling
- Printing to stdout
- JSON serialization/deserialization (in later tasks)
## Task 0: Read file
`0-read_file.py` defines `read_file(filename="")` which reads a UTF-8 text file and prints its content to stdout. It uses `with` and avoids imports, as required.

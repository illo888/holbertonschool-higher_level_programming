# Python - Inheritance

## Description
This project explores inheritance in Python, one of the fundamental pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. We learn about parent classes, child classes, method overriding, and the powerful concepts of single and multiple inheritance.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand superclass, baseclass, and parentclass concepts
- Master subclass creation and inheritance
- Learn to list all attributes and methods of a class
- Understand when instances can have new attributes
- Master class inheritance and multiple base classes
- Learn about the default object class
- Understand method and attribute overriding
- Master isinstance, issubclass, type, and super built-in functions

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.5
- pycodestyle 2.7.*
- All files must be executable
- All modules, classes, and methods must have documentation
- Test files should be in tests/ directory

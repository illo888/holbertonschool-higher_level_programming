# Python - Abstract Classes and Interfaces

## Description
This project delves into advanced Object-Oriented Programming principles in Python, with a focus on abstract base classes, interfaces, duck typing, multiple inheritance, and mixin patterns. The goal is to master flexible and maintainable class hierarchies using Python's ABC module and core OOP concepts.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and implement abstract classes and abstract methods
- Apply interfaces and duck typing for flexible polymorphism
- Extend Python's built-in classes (list, iterator) with custom behavior
- Master method overriding techniques
- Utilize multiple inheritance effectively
- Compose behavior using mixins

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.5
- All files must be executable
- Comprehensive documentation for all modules, classes, and methods
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
